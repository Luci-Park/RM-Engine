# Templates

RM Engine uses a standardized format for license headers in all source and header files. Visual Studio templates implementing these headers are located in the templates folder within the main directory. Run the batch file corresponding to your Visual Studio installation's item templates directory. The script currently supports Visual Studio 2022 and 2026 (VS 18).

## Making changes to the VS Templates

> **IMPORTANT**: If you are making chages to the VS Templates then the `CHANGELOG.md` file also needs to be updated.

If you would like to make changes to the VS Template then they have to be made in the `src` folder and manually zipped and updated to the root folder.
